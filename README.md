# POPAIv2.0
MATLAB algorithms to predict Sedentary Behaviour (i.e. inactive sitting) from single body worn sensors, either a thigh-worn activPAL or a waist-worn ActiGraph.

The activPAL algorithm classifies the recorded behaviour into sedentary behaviour, active sitting, standing, and stepping. 
The ActiGraph algorithm classifies the recorded behaviour into sedentary behaviour, active sitting, inactive standing, active standing, and stepping.

When using either of the algorithms, please cite the studies describing their development:
